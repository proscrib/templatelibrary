# templatelibrary

<p>So where to start.  I was tasked by my employer to create a template library for the mountains of html emails that I build.  This of course is part of a much larger team showcase package. So at the same time we need something for our final Code Louisville Project, so I need to double down and see what I can make of this.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to just get started, sort of stand this up as it were. At this moment I want to have a fixed header and footer but further down if those items are to be fixed I would like to include more useful information. But not today.  Not yet.  Now, for the body, I would like to tab it.  That may change later. For the moment I find it useful in holding to a simple environment for the user to browse.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>I've been pulling from several areas, some from what I've collected through Treehouse and Slack MDN, Bootstrap, others from my history of learning on my own, like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3schools">w3schools.com</a>.</p>
